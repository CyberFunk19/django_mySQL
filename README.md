This is the first time that i used mySQL and connected it to django back-end.
keep in mind that in order to make the program work you need to follow this steps:
first, you need to enter the virtual enviroment.
second, you'll need to install the requirements file using: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
also, you need to change the password to the mySQL data base in the "settings.py" file.  
enjoy :)
